/* utilities/_motion.scss
   Respect users who prefer reduced motion.
   - Globally minimizes animation/transition durations when the user opts out.
   - You can still author animations in components; users with "reduce" wonâ€™t get them.
   Reference:
   - prefers-reduced-motion: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion
*/
@use "../abstracts/mixins" as m;

/* Global guard: drastically reduce motion for users who selected "reduce" */
@include m.prefers-reduced-motion {

  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.001ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.001ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}

/* Optional helper class: only run motion when user has no preference.
   Usage example in a component:
     @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
       .fade-in { transition: opacity 150ms; }
     }
   (We expose this pattern here as a comment, to keep utilities minimal.) */

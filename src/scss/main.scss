/* src/scss/main.scss
   Entry point for the 7–1 architecture.
   Load order matters:
   1) abstracts   – tokens, functions, mixins (no CSS output ideally)
   2) base        – resets and element defaults
   3) layout      – structural layout primitives (containers, grid)
   4) components  – discrete UI chunks (buttons, cards, nav)
   5) sections    – page/section-specific styles
   6) utilities   – helpers and one-off utility classes

   Notes:
   - Tokens were added in Issue #8.
   - Focus + reduced-motion utilities are Issue #9 (this step).

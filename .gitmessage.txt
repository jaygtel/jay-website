# <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
#   type = feat | fix | chore | docs | build | ci | refactor | style | test
#   scope = optional, e.g. home, a11y, build
#   summary = imperative mood, <=72 chars

# Example:
# fix(home): enforce single H1

# --- Commit Body ---
# Explain what changed and why, wrapped at ~72 chars.
# Focus on intent and context, not obvious syntax.

# Example:
# Demote About section to H2 so the Home page only has one H1.
# Improves semantic hierarchy and accessibility.

# --- Issue Reference(s) ---
# Use Ref # for commits (we only auto-close on dev->main).
# Example:
# Ref #10
